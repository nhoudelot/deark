The unsit.h file is based on Huffman decompression code excerpted from Unsit
(unsit.c) Version 1 by Allan G. Weber.
It was downloaded from <http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/mac/unix/unsit.shar>.

The latest date that appears in this version of Unsit is January 15, 1988. I
have every reason to believe that this software was released in the United
States prior to March 1, 1989, intentionally without a copyright notice. To the
best of my understanding, that means it is in the public domain.

It has been substantially modified for use in Deark. Modifications for Deark
are Copyright (C) 2019 Jason Summers, and may be redistributed under the same
terms of use as the main Deark software.
